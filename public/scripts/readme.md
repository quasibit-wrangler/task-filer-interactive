### Modals.js
This js file handles the addition of each type of modal into the page.


When you click the "+" button the general modal opens up. in this modal there is:
| Iems  |  Descriptions |
| ----- | ------------- |
| - Who | ....          |
| - What | ...          |
| - Where | ...         |
| - When | ...          |

Here there are 4 different options  that have to be filled out for each entry, and each
one of those if different so they will be using a difference modal.

Each one of these queries will be filled out to make a post, since they are contained all in
general modal, this means that they have to send info back to the general modal for containerization.
And all modals must be filled before sending to the database.
