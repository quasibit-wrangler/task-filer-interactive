### Modals.js
This js file handles the addition of each type of modal into the page.


When you click the "+" button the general modal opens up. in this modal there is:
| Iems  |  Descriptions |
| ----- | ------------- |
| - Who | Here there are 4 different options  that have to be filled out for each entry, and each one of those if different so they will be using a difference modal.
| - What
| - Where
| - When

Each one of these queries will be filled out to make a post, since they are contained all in
general modal, this means that they have to send info back to the general modal for containerization.
